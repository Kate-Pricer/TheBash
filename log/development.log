On January 18th 2013, in Lapeer; with the closest members of their families, they entered into the union of marriage. The ceremony was fun, but now it is time to celebrate in the warmth of summer.﻿ They would be honored if you would join them. It would be magical to have the people they love and have helped shape who they are; together in one place, at one time, gathered in a spirit of love.
